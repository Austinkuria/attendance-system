1.2 Background
Managing student attendance effectively is a cornerstone of educational institutions, ensuring accountability, meeting academic requirements, and keeping reliable records. Traditionally, schools have relied on manual methods like roll calls or sign-in sheets. These approaches, though straightforward, take up valuable time and often lead to mistakes—missed names or forgotten signatures can easily throw off the accuracy of the records (Masalha & Hirzallah, 2014).
As technology has evolved, many institutions have turned to digital solutions to improve this process. Systems like biometric scanners using fingerprints or facial recognition, mobile apps for students to check themselves in, and RFID-based tracking have made attendance more precise and efficient compared to older methods (Patel et al., 2019). Yet, these advancements come with their own challenges. Biometric tools require costly equipment and spark privacy worries, mobile apps depend on consistent internet access and aren’t always user-friendly for everyone, and RFID setups involve hefty investments in infrastructure (Sharma & Kumar, 2019). These hurdles point to a clear need for a solution that’s affordable, easy to use, and widely accessible.
That’s where my proposed Smart QR Code Based Student Attendance System comes in. By generating unique QR codes for each class session, students can simply scan them with their smartphones to log their presence, instantly updating a central database. This system promises to streamline attendance tracking, boost accuracy, and even make the process more engaging for students, offering a fresh take on a routine task in education.
1.3 Current/Existing System
Today, many schools have embraced digital tools to move beyond the limitations of manual roll calls, adopting options like biometric systems, RFID tags, and QR code-based applications. These technologies certainly improve on paper-based methods, but they don’t fully solve the problem. Biometric systems, which rely on fingerprints or facial scans, deliver solid accuracy but come with high costs for hardware and raise valid privacy concerns among students (Federal Trade Commission, 2023). RFID systems use tags to track attendance, but the expense of setting up the necessary infrastructure often puts them out of reach for smaller schools. QR code-based systems, while simpler and cheaper, still have gaps my project aims to address. For instance, many lack robust security measures like user authentication, making it easy for one student to scan a code for another—a practice known as proxy attendance that undermines trust in the data (Pati, S., et al., 2023). Some systems don’t verify the student’s identity or device, leaving room for errors, while others struggle with delayed updates or require constant internet access, which isn’t practical in areas with spotty connectivity. Educators sometimes get tools like attendance dashboards, but these can be clunky and demand technical know-how that not every lecturer has. Plus, most of these systems focus solely on recording presence, missing chances to involve students through features like feedback or interaction, which could enrich the classroom experience.
The cost and complexity of these options often deter schools from adopting them. Setting them up might mean extensive training or pricey equipment—barriers that smaller institutions simply can’t overcome. While QR code technology offers a promising starting point, current versions often fall short on accuracy, usability, and student engagement. My proposed Smart QR Code Based Student Attendance System aims to bridge these gaps with a practical, user-friendly design and innovative features tailored for today’s classrooms.
1.4 Problem Statement
Attendance tracking in most schools faces real challenges that need a better fix. Old-school methods like roll calls or sign-in sheets eat up 10-15 minutes of class time and are prone to slip-ups—lecturers might miss a name, or students might forget to sign in. Worse, proxy attendance, where one student marks another as present, happens too often, eroding trust in the records and accountability among students.
Newer tech solutions have tried to tackle these issues, but they’re not perfect. Biometric systems using fingerprints or facial scans are spot-on but cost a fortune and make students uneasy about their privacy. Mobile apps sound great until you realize they need reliable internet, which isn’t guaranteed everywhere, and they can stump students who aren’t tech-savvy. QR code systems simplify things, but most don’t secure against proxy attendance, update records in real time, or offer ways to engage students beyond a quick check-in (Pati, S., et al., 2023). This leaves schools stuck with options that are either too expensive, too complicated, or just not complete.
That’s why I’m proposing the Smart QR Code Based Student Attendance System for my final-year project. It’s designed to provide accurate tracking, stop proxy attendance in its tracks, and build a stronger link between students and educators—addressing the shortcomings of what’s out there now (Student Attendance Information System Using QR Code At ITSNU Kalimantan, 2022; Enhancing attendance tracking using animated QR codes, 2023).
1.5 Proposed System
My Smart QR Code Based Attendance System aims to tackle the inefficiencies and frustrations of traditional attendance methods head-on. Built using the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js—this system will offer a straightforward, efficient way to track attendance in schools, making it more reliable and even enjoyable for everyone involved. It’s about turning a mundane task into something that supports better classroom management and student participation.
Key Features
This system brings practical tools to the table with a smart, tech-driven approach. For every class, a unique QR code will be generated, which students can scan using their smartphones to log their attendance instantly—data goes straight into a MongoDB database for easy access. Real-time updates mean the records sync across devices immediately, so lecturers and administrators always have the latest info without delays. In spots with shaky internet, an offline mode lets students check in anyway, storing the data locally in the browser and syncing it up once they’re back online. Security is a big focus here—device tracking and secure logins handled by Express.js and Node.js will confirm each student’s identity, making proxy attendance a thing of the past. To keep students involved, I’ve included feedback forms and interactive dashboards built with React, so they can share their thoughts post-class, and lecturers can get a clear picture of how things are going.
Benefits
This setup offers real advantages that tackle today’s challenges and improve the classroom experience. QR codes will cut out errors like missed names or forgotten signatures, giving us records we can trust. Accountability will go up since secure logins and device checks stop anyone from faking attendance, encouraging students to show up. It’s fast, too—quick scans save the time roll calls waste, letting classes kick off sooner. Engagement gets a boost with feedback tools that invite students to chime in and give lecturers useful insights into their classes. Best of all, it’s budget-friendly and scalable, relying on smartphones instead of pricey gear, so any school can adopt it without breaking the bank. Together, these perks promise a smoother, more dependable, and interactive way to handle attendance.
1.6 Purpose of the Study
For my final-year project, I’m designing and building the Smart QR Code Based Student Attendance System to overhaul how schools track attendance. Using QR code technology and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), this system will swap out slow, mistake-prone manual methods—like roll calls that drag on and miss students—for a fast, accurate alternative. It’s meant to solve big issues: stopping proxy attendance with secure logins, giving educators real-time data, and getting students more involved with tools like feedback forms and dashboards. This isn’t just about making daily roll calls easier—it’ll help lecturers spot attendance patterns instantly and let administrators keep tabs on participation school-wide. For students, it’s a simple way to stay connected, turning attendance into a stepping stone for better learning. My goal is to deliver a practical, affordable tool that boosts efficiency, builds responsibility, and ties teaching and learning closer together.
1.7 General Objective
To create and roll out a strong attendance management system that uses QR code technology to make the process efficient, secure, and user-friendly in schools.
1.8 Specific Objectives
To improve attendance accuracy in real time using QR codes.  

To block proxy attendance with device tracking and user authentication.  

To boost student engagement through tools like feedback forms after attendance.

1.9 Justification
This Smart QR Code Based Student Attendance System is worth pursuing because it reimagines how schools handle attendance, offering a practical and cost-effective fix to today’s challenges. Manual methods like roll calls are sluggish and error-prone, while biometric systems, though reliable, come with steep costs and privacy issues many schools can’t manage. My system sidesteps these problems by offering a scalable solution that works anywhere—from small classrooms to big universities—using just smartphones, no fancy equipment needed.
More than just solving those headaches, it taps into a growing demand in education for data-driven tools, as schools look to track engagement and performance more closely (Ng & Kee, 2021). It’ll give lecturers real-time insights to catch participation trends and spot where students might need support, turning attendance into a way to enhance learning, not just log it. With its low cost, ease of use, and student engagement features like feedback, this system brings real value to schools looking for smart, modern solutions—making it a solid choice for my final-year project.
1.10 Scope
My Smart QR Code Based Student Attendance System is designed to shake up attendance management in schools by cutting out the inefficiencies and errors of old methods. It centers on real-time tracking with QR codes—each class gets a unique code that students scan with their smartphones, logging their presence straight into a MongoDB database. This slashes admin work and keeps records spot-on. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), it’ll sync data instantly using Node.js and Express.js, allow offline check-ins with browser storage that syncs later, and use secure logins to stop proxy attendance.
It’s built for three key users: lecturers, students, and administrators, each with features that fit their needs. Lecturers can generate QR codes and check attendance live on a React interface, students scan to log in and view their history, and administrators get detailed reports to track trends across the school. I’ll develop it using Agile methods, gathering feedback from users during design and testing, then run pilot tests in a few classrooms to iron out kinks before a full launch, backed by training and support.
The tech setup uses React for a responsive web app that works on phones or computers, with Express.js and Node.js running the backend and MongoDB keeping data safe. It’s simple and affordable, needing no special hardware beyond smartphones. That said, it assumes students have phones, which might not hold true for all, and while offline mode helps, some features need internet. The focus stays on attendance, not wider academic tracking, to keep things clear and effective.
1.11 Limitations
This system promises big improvements over traditional attendance tracking, but it’s not without challenges. It depends on students having smartphones to scan QR codes, and not everyone might have one or reliable internet at home, especially in less tech-savvy areas. That could leave some students out, creating uneven participation.
Technical hiccups during setup or daily use—like bugs or server downtimes—could also disrupt classes if they’re not fixed fast, so solid support will be key. And since it collects data like attendance times and device info, I’ll need to lock down security to protect privacy and avoid breaches, which adds extra responsibility. These hurdles will take careful planning to make sure the system works smoothly for everyone.
1.12 Significance of the Study
This project matters because it turns attendance management into a tool for better education. It’ll make schools more efficient, swapping slow manual methods for a quick, accurate system that saves time and cuts errors. It’ll hold students accountable by using secure logins to stop proxy attendance, ensuring the records show who’s really there. Lecturers will get real-time data and dashboards to see participation patterns and spot where students need help.
Beyond that, it’ll get students more involved across different school settings with feedback tools that let them share thoughts after class—something inspired by today’s push for interactive learning. Attendance won’t just be a checkmark; it’ll spark conversations between lecturers and students, opening doors to improve teaching and learning, as technology can connect people in new ways (Rikala & Kankaanranta, 2014). By delivering all this at a low cost with the MERN stack, my project offers schools a practical, impactful solution that works now and sets the stage for the future.

2.2 Related Literature Review
QR code-based attendance systems have come a long way lately, bringing fresh ways to track students in schools. This section looks at what’s out there—existing systems and studies—checking their strengths and weaknesses to pinpoint where my Smart QR Code Based Student Attendance System can step in. Built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), it’s designed to improve accuracy, security, offline support, and student involvement.
Classroom Attendance by QR Code (CATQR) is a free mobile app aimed at schools, letting students scan class-specific QR codes with their phones to log attendance, sometimes with geolocation checks. It’s handy but falters when internet drops, delaying updates, and its optional geolocation feature can turn off privacy-wary students. My system will tackle this with strong offline support—saving data locally and syncing later—for broader reach and accuracy. CATQR’s calendar logs past scans for teachers to review trends, per its App Store page (App Store), but my approach automates real-time analytics to save time.
SEAtS Software ramps up attendance and engagement with QR codes, GPS, and instant notifications. Still, it skimps on per-check-in authentication, risking proxy attendance, and its offline mode doesn’t record during outages. Masalha and Hirzallah (2014) flag similar security gaps, backing this up. My system will lock in secure logins and offline features to close those holes (SEAtS Software, 2023, SEAtS).
OneTap Check-In uses QR codes and NFC to speed things up across industries, including education, but its engagement tools—like optional surveys—are thin, and offline mode needs setup, with kiosks adding costs. Patel et al. (2019) stress engagement’s role in participation, a gap my system fills with feedback and affordability.
AccuClass, from Engineerica Systems, offers QR code or proximity tracking for schools with a mobile app. It handles custom schedules but lags on reporting without internet, and its offline mode only works with pre-loaded data, which can confuse users. My system will keep offline marking seamless and easy to use.
CourseKey targets vocational schools with real-time tracking via QR codes, biometrics, and sound. It automates well but leaves proxy attendance risks due to spotty authentication, and its offline mode flops without connectivity, plus it’s pricey. My system will deliver steady security and low-cost offline options, making it more practical.
