Database Design
Normalization Analysis:

1. First Normal Form (1NF)
   - All tables have primary keys (_id)
   - Each column contains atomic values
   - No repeating groups
   
2. Second Normal Form (2NF)
   - Meets 1NF
   - No partial dependencies
   - Tables organized by complete functional dependencies
   
3. Third Normal Form (3NF)
   - Meets 2NF
   - No transitive dependencies
   - Each non-key attribute directly depends on primary key

Key Entity Relationships Explained:

1. User (Student) - Course Relationship
   - One-to-Many: A course can have multiple students
   - Each student belongs to one course
   - Constraints: Course enrollment must match student's year/semester

2. User (Lecturer) - Unit Relationship
   - One-to-Many: A lecturer can teach multiple units
   - Each unit has one assigned lecturer
   - Managed through assignedUnits array in User model

3. Session - Attendance Relationship
   - One-to-Many: A session has multiple attendance records
   - Each attendance record belongs to one session
   - Enforces device fingerprinting and QR validation

4. Course - Unit Hierarchy
   - One-to-Many: A course contains multiple units
   - Units are organized by year and semester
   - Maintains academic structure integrity

5. Department - Course Organization

CHAPTER 5: 
SYSTEM TESTING AND IMPLEMENTATION

Introduction

The testing phase for the QR Code-based Smart Attendance System employed a practical approach focused on real-world usability and security validation. While our initial methodology outlined an extensive testing framework, our actual implementation prioritized critical features and core functionality testing to ensure a reliable system for everyday academic use.

Our testing focused on three critical aspects essential to the system's success:
1. Attendance tracking accuracy and QR code reliability
2. Anti-spoofing mechanism effectiveness
3. User experience across different devices and network conditions

Testing Environment:
- Physical testing in actual classroom environments at our institution
- Various mobile devices including Android smartphones (Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo) and iPhones
- Different network conditions (campus WiFi, 4G/5G, low connectivity simulation)
- Multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) to ensure cross-platform compatibility

Key Testing Activities:

1. Functional Testing
   - Manual testing of QR code generation, scanning, and validation
   - User role-based access control verification
   - End-to-end attendance session flow validation
   - Feedback submission and analysis workflow

2. Security Testing
   - Manual QR code replay attempt tests
   - Device fingerprinting verification
   - Multiple session access attempts from same device
   - JWT token validation

3. Performance Assessment
   - Response time measurements under normal usage conditions
   - Simultaneous session creation testing
   - Multiple concurrent QR scan handling
   - Database query optimization verification

4. User Acceptance Testing
   - Field testing with actual students and lecturers from the Computing Department
   - Focus group sessions to gather qualitative feedback
   - Interface improvement iterations based on user feedback
   - Training sessions to evaluate learnability

The testing process identified and addressed approximately 25 issues before deployment, with prioritization given to critical security concerns and core functionality problems. While not achieving the 83% code coverage aspired to in the methodology, our focused manual testing ensured that essential features worked reliably in real-world conditions.
