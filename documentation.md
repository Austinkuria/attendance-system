CHAPTER 4: 
SYSTEM DESIGN

Introduction
The QRollCall Smart Attendance System is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to modernize student attendance tracking in educational institutions. Built on the MERN stack, the system provides a secure, efficient solution for monitoring classroom attendance. The system has been implemented with:

Technical Architecture:
The frontend is built using React.js with Vite and implements the Ant Design UI framework with custom theming for light and dark modes. The backend utilizes Node.js and Express with a RESTful API architecture, while data is stored in MongoDB Atlas with Mongoose ODM for data modeling and validation. Authentication is managed through JWT-based secure mechanisms with role-based access control. Browser localStorage provides data persistence with offline functionality through PWA capabilities. The deployment infrastructure consists of frontend hosting on Vercel and backend services on Render.com for optimal scalability and performance.

Core Components:
1. Frontend Application
   The system implements a Progressive Web Application (PWA) with service workers for offline access and responsive design using Ant Design components that adapt to various screen sizes. It features a QR code scanner utilizing device cameras with guided positioning overlay for improved user experience. Real-time attendance updates are achieved through efficient polling mechanisms, while browser localStorage enables session persistence and offline data access for users with inconsistent connectivity.

2. Backend Services
   The backend implements Express REST API endpoints organized in MVC architecture with JWT authentication including token refresh mechanisms for persistent sessions. Security is enhanced through rate limiting protection (15 requests/minute) to prevent abuse. Administrative functions are supported through CSV import/export functionality for bulk user management, and all database operations use Mongoose ODM to ensure data integrity and validation.

3. Database Architecture
   The system utilizes MongoDB collections with optimized schema design to store and manage all application data. Core collections include Users, Sessions, Attendance, Units, Courses, Departments, and Feedback, all connected through reference-based relationships using MongoDB Object IDs for data consistency and efficient querying.

4. Data Layer
   This layer manages the storage and retrieval of data throughout the system. MongoDB Collections store user data, session information, attendance records, units, courses, departments, and feedback data with appropriate indexing for performance. The system also implements file storage for QR code images, CSV exports, user uploads, and system logs to maintain comprehensive records of all activities.

5. Security Infrastructure
   The security layer ensures the integrity and protection of the system and its data. Authentication is handled through JWT token validation, role-based authorization, device fingerprinting, and session management techniques. Request protection includes rate limiting, CORS protection, input validation, and comprehensive error handling to prevent common web vulnerabilities and attacks.

6. External Services Integration
   The system integrates with several external services to provide its full functionality. Hosting is managed through Vercel for the frontend, Render.com for the backend, and MongoDB Atlas for database services. Email communications are handled through Nodemailer SMTP for sending password reset links, notifications, and system alerts to users.

7. Data Flows
   The system implements well-defined data flow patterns between components. Client to backend communication occurs through HTTPS REST calls, JWT authentication, form submissions, and file uploads. Backend to database interactions use Mongoose queries, atomic operations, index utilization, and data validation. The system also manages external flows including email dispatch, file storage operations, hosting services communication, and monitoring activities.

Requirements
Functional Requirements:

1. Authentication & Authorization
   The system implements JWT-based secure authentication with refresh tokens to maintain user sessions securely. Role-based access control is enforced for Admin, Lecturer, and Student roles with appropriate permissions for each. Password reset functionality allows users to recover access when needed, and device identification enhances security by tracking and verifying the devices used to access the system.

2. Session Management
   QR code generation with automatic refresh every 3 minutes prevents code sharing and replay attacks. Session state persistence using localStorage ensures continuity of user experience across page reloads. The system provides flexible session timing controls for starting and ending attendance periods, and lecturers can manually override attendance status when necessary to accommodate exceptional circumstances.

3. Anti-Spoofing Measures
   Device fingerprinting collects and verifies browser information including userAgent, platform, screen dimensions, color and pixel depth, hardware concurrency, and language settings. IP address tracking combined with time-based conflict detection prevents simultaneous access from different locations. QR code expiration and rotation with SHA-256 hash verification ensures codes cannot be reused or shared. Session token validation and rate limiting on sensitive endpoints provide additional layers of security against automated attacks and abuse.

4. Data Management
   The system supports bulk student import and export via CSV files to simplify administrative tasks. Comprehensive course and unit management tools allow institutions to maintain their academic structure accurately. Department organization features provide higher-level management of institutional hierarchy. Attendance records can be exported in CSV or Excel format for reporting and record-keeping, and the system includes basic analytics and reporting functions to track attendance trends and patterns.

5. User Experience
   Responsive design ensures optimal display and functionality on both mobile and desktop devices. Light and dark theme support accommodates user preferences and reduces eye strain in different lighting conditions. Offline access to previously loaded data allows users to review information even without internet connectivity. Basic caching mechanisms enhance performance by reducing load times for frequently accessed content.

Non-Functional Requirements:

1. Security
   The system prioritizes security through secure authentication with JWT technology to protect user sessions and access. Device fingerprinting validation adds an additional layer of identity verification to prevent unauthorized access. Role-based access control ensures users can only access functions appropriate to their position. Input validation and sanitization protect against injection attacks and malformed data. API rate limiting prevents abuse through excessive requests that could degrade system performance.

2. Performance
   Database queries are optimized through appropriate indexing and query structure to ensure rapid response times even with large datasets. Client-side caching of frequently accessed data reduces server load and improves user experience. Offline functionality through localStorage enables basic system use during connectivity interruptions. Automatic data refresh mechanisms ensure users always see current information without manual intervention.

3. Usability
   The system implements a responsive mobile-first design approach to ensure optimal display and functionality across all device types and screen sizes. The intuitive user interface built with Ant Design components provides familiar interaction patterns and clear visual hierarchy. Theme customization with light and dark modes accommodates user preferences and different viewing environments. Cross-browser compatibility ensures consistent functionality in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and other modern browsers.

4. Reliability
   Comprehensive error handling provides clear feedback to users when problems occur. Automatic session cleanup prevents resource leakage and ensures system stability. Token refresh mechanisms maintain user sessions without requiring frequent re-authentication. Data validation at both client and server levels prevents corruption of the database and ensures information integrity throughout the system.

5. Scalability
   The modular architecture allows components to be updated or replaced without affecting the entire system. Separation of frontend and backend enables independent scaling based on different resource requirements. Cloud deployment readiness ensures the system can expand to accommodate growing user bases. The API-based architecture provides a foundation for future extensibility and integration with other systems.

6. Maintainability
   Component-based frontend design simplifies updates and feature additions by isolating functionality into manageable units. The MVC pattern in the backend creates clear separation of concerns for easier debugging and enhancement. Central configuration management simplifies deployment across different environments. Environment variable management allows configuration changes without code modifications.
